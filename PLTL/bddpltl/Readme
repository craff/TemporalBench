bddpltl requires the Buddy bdd package. 
On Debian systems, the following should work:

apt-get install libbdd-dev

To compile the prover a simple

make

should suffice.


To run the prover, use the following:

./bddpltl [args] < input.pltl

with the following arguments:

	 -sat		   Check satisfiability
	 -valid		   Check validity
	 -v n		   Set verbosity of output
	 -silent	   Disable garbage collection messages
	 -autoreorder  Enable automatic variable reordering
	 -nonormalise  Do not preprocess the formula
	 -nosortand	   When computing conjunctions, do not attempt to find a better order
	 -noassumeG	   Do not convert top-level G-formulae into explicit global assumptions. Mandatory with -valid
	 -nary		   Treat conjunction and disjunction as n-ary rather than binary, allowing for informed conjunctions/disjunctions unless -nosortand is specified

Note that one of -sat and -valid is required.

The syntax for the prover is as follows

True	   	   	   top
False			   bottom
p & q			   conjunction
p | q			   disjunction
p => q 			   implication
p <=> q			   equivalence
X p	  			   Next
F p				   Eventuality
G p				   Always
(p U q)			   Until
(p B q) 		   Before
